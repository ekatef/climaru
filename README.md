Helper package for preprocessing meteorological records provided by the All-Russian Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information - World Data Center (RIHMI WDC). The data base is a unique source of the original observations data on the weather and climate (ambient air temperature, precipitation amount, atmospheric pressure, humidity, soil temperature etc) across a large part of Northern Eurasia. The data are available via meteo.ru/data after a simple registration procedure (aisori-m.meteo.ru/waisori/registration.xhtml). The package is intended to facilitate loading, extraction and meta-data management.

The package is currently under development. Stay tuned!
